# Review: Garbage Collection
- A tool that automatically manage "Dangling objects" of the programs.
- So thanks to the automatic garbage collection process, programmers became free from the sress that they should manage memory distribution and allocation by themselves! 
- (From google search results & my understanding based summary)

# Lesson: Pointer Chain Operations
### What I have learned 
- extended pointer frame
- remote_get: is this for moving the data to farther away? Should look into the details of pytorch pysyft code
"""

import torch as th
!pip install syft
import syft as sy

hook = sy.TorchHook(th)
bob = sy.VirtualWorker(hook, id = 'bob')

alice = sy.VirtualWorker(hook, id = 'alice')

bob._objects

alice._objects #obvisouly, non, those are just freshly made ones.

x = th.tensor([1,2,3,4,5]).send('bob').send('alice')

bob._objects

alice._objects

x.remote_get()

bob._objects

alice._objects # wow this is cool!
