1. Secure and Private AI Challenge
- Watched Webinar (around 60%) 
	- Just dive in.
	- You are not your code. 
	- By just using the code, also a contribution, (since you could find some bugs that the developers could think of before!) 
	- How your code work in othersâ€™ devices and how those would communicate with other devices
